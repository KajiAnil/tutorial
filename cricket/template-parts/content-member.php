                    <blockquote class="blockquote">Paras Khadka is known as one of the best players Nepal has ever produced and is current captain of the national side. He has also played at the Under-15 and Under-17 levels. A middle-order batsman who also bowls medium pace, he represented Nepal in the Under-19 World Cups of 2004, 2006 and 2008 while also being a part of the senior side. In the Plate semi-final against South Africa in 2006, Khadka was responsible for taking his side through to the finals. He was also the highest wicket-taker for Nepal in that tournament. </blockquote>

                    <blockquote class="blockquote">Gyanendra Malla is an Nepali right-handed batsman who plays for the Yangal Club. He was a part of the Nepal Under-15 and Under-19 squad before joining the senior side. He participated in the 2006 Under-19 Cricket World Cup in Sri Lanka. He had a good time scoring 145 runs in six innings, including a gritty 45 in a famous two-run win against South Africa in the Plate semi-final. Due to this performance, he was appointed as the vice-captain for the 2008 Under-19 Cricket World Cup in Malaysia. </blockquote>
